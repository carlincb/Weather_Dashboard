## Description

- What was my motivation? I needed to create an application using a third-party API, which could check the weather conditions in specific cities for potential journeys.

- What problem does it solve? This project creates a weather application, which finds pertinent data about weather conditions in specific cities.
- What did I learn? I learned about OpenWeather One Call API, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Google Fonts.

    WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
    WHEN I view the UV index
    THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
    WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
